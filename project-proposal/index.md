# Project Proposal

## Introduction
A massive open online course (MOOC) is a special type of online course aimed towards a large group of participants and is openly accessible via the internet. MOOCs are a fairly recent development in open distance education and are mostly non-credit granting and free [(Florida Tech)](https://libguides.lib.fit.edu/c.php?g=427753&p=2917513). This project aims to answer the following questions surrounding MOOCs:
* Who are the learners that sign up for MOOCs? What is their educational background, where are they located, and what is their motivation for enrolling in a MOOC?
* Are MOOCs an effective method of learning? That is, how many people actually complete these courses and feel that it was an effective way to learn new concepts?
* Could MOOCs replace or transform current methods of traditional education (e.g. secondary school, college, and university)? That is, to what extent are educational institutions adding online courses, similar to MOOCs, to their curriculum?

We will employ a variety of Digital History methods to answer these research questions, as detailed in the next section, due to the large amount of data to be reviewed. Due to MOOCs naturally being digital, as they were created in only the past decade and only live online, these methods will be vital in our research and are the most efficient and effective way to analyze MOOC data.


## Methods
This project will use the following digital history methods, with inspiration from [scholars of Rice University](https://ricedh.github.io/), to answer our research questions:

* Mapping geographic points to create graphics representing students enrolled in MOOCs. [ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html) will be used to create digital maps for visualization and analytical purposes of understanding the learners of MOOCs.
* Topic modelling to find a group of words (i.e. topic) from a collection of MOOC materials that best represents the information in a MOOC or collection of MOOCs. This method will also be used for discovering patterns in student feedback/comments for MOOCs. This will aid us in aggregating the vast amount of material to form a picture of MOOCs and find answers to our research questions. [Carrot2](https://search.carrot2.org/#/search/web/MOOC/pie-chart) will be utilized as a starting point to understand what types of search results are frequent regarding MOOCs. [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) will be used as our main topic modelling tool to discover clusters of words frequently occuring together.
* Analyzing social media history (e.g. Twitter) to understand the sentiment, impact, and relevance of MOOCs. The [NCSU Tweet Sentiment Visualization App](https://www.csc2.ncsu.edu/faculty/healey/tweet_viz/tweet_app/) will be used for analyzing tweets and creating scatter plots showing the overall pleasantness and emotions surrounding keywords related to MOOCs.
