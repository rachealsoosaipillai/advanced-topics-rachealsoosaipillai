# Silicon Valley as a Shifting Location

Silicon Valley is widely known to be the worldâ€™s "foremost high-tech region grew up on the northern end of Santa Clara County" [Adams et al., p. 3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). This was a true statement around 1983 due to many technology companies being in Santa Clara County at the time. However, this became less and less true closer to the end of the 1980s due to developments, to be described in the next section, that caused the centre of technology activity to move farther from San Francisco.

**Note to TA: I plan to use a chit after the initial grading to resubmit this assignment. Please let me know if you think this topic, based on the above paragraph, is suitable for this spatial assignment. Thank you.**

Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, before the map and buttons. To change the colors, modify the defaults in style.css.
