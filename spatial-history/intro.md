# Silicon Valley as a Shifting Location

Silicon Valley is widely known to be the worldâ€™s "foremost high-tech region grew up on the northern end of Santa Clara County" [(Adams et al., p. 860)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). This was a true statement around 1983 due to many technology companies being located in Santa Clara County at the time. However, in actuality Silicon Valley is not a technology centre that was formed in Santa Clara County but instead a region whose geographic centre shifted southward from San Francisco, over the course of the second half of the twentieth century, mainly due to the influence of the Stanford Industrial Park and the semiconductor.
