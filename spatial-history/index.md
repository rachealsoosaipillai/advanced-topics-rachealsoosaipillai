From its inception, Silicon Valley was a technology region composed of two places. Silicon Valley resided in the Bay Area from 1909 to 1931 with its first major high-tech firm, the Federal Telegraph Company, that had locations for manufacturing and research in Palo Alto as well as administration and marketing in San Francisco [(Adams et al., p. 861)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). Labour was divided between San Mateo County, the county just south of San Francisco, and Santa Clara County until the 1970s. 

The southward move of Silicon Valley was instigated by two pioneers in electronics, namely Charles Litton and Russell Varian. Litton held a graduate degree at Stanford and spent two years at Bell Telephone Laboratories before transitioning into creating transmission tubes at the Federal Telegraph Company from 1927 to 1931 [(Lécuyer, p. 22)](https://books-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/uri/ebooks/ebooks3/proquest-up/2018-09-25/8/9780262322591). When the Federal Telegraph Company left the Bay Area, Litton then formed Litton Engineering Laboratories, a manufacturer of vacuum tube machinery located in San Mateo County [(Lécuyer, p. 30)](https://books-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/uri/ebooks/ebooks3/proquest-up/2018-09-25/8/9780262322591). Varian also graduated from Stanford, then later worked for San Francisco television inventor Philo Farnsworth. He worked alongside Professor William Hansen to develop the klystron tube, a specialized linear-beam vacuum tube, that had important uses in radar technology. From 1938, Varian and his brother worked at Stanford University in a contract with Sperry Gyroscope Company, a company based in Stanford. Later in 1948, the brothers created their own company Varian Associates in San Carlos, located near Litton’s vacuum tube manufacturing plant [(Lécuyer, p. 92)](https://books-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/uri/ebooks/ebooks3/proquest-up/2018-09-25/8/9780262322591). In addition to Varian and Litton, telecommunications companies and manufacturers of audio and video equipment were also founded or relocated to San Mateo County, San Bruno, and San Carlos before 1950. At this time, Hewlett-Packard, an electronic instrumentation company, was the only large firm in the region from Santa Clara County as the others were closer to San Francisco and mainly based in San Mateo County [(Lécuyer, p. 50)](https://books-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/uri/ebooks/ebooks3/proquest-up/2018-09-25/8/9780262322591).

During the 1950s, Stanford University began to have more sway over high-tech firms due to the university’s reputation as a “developer of brains”. Moreover, Stanford began to develop land as well and leased some of their unused land for residential use, a shopping complex, and more importantly for industrial use [(Adams et al., p. 862)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). Despite Stanford receiving the “lion’s share of attention”, by the 1960s a new division of labour for engineering education was developed in the Valley [(Adams et al., p. 864)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). New programs were created in the following two decades: UC Berkeley in Sunnyvale, Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, and San Jose State University in San Jose. Together, these new programs played a role in the gradual southward shift of the Valley’s tech centre from San Mateo County.

The Stanford Industrial Park was formed in 1951 as a prelude to the eventual suburban industrial cluster. The Park became a magnet for companies seeking recent graduates of Stanford and consultants from the university’s faculty. Moreover, these companies offered their employees a chance to earn their graduate degrees [(Adams et al., p. 862)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). In 1956, Hewlett-Packard moved its headquarters to the Park. Around 30 years later, the Park was home to 55 companies with 26,000 workers. The success of the Park also inspired similar developments south of Palo Alto. Although these developments were not associated with a large university like Stanford, they soon became a standard in Santa Clara County and by 1967 there were 38 industrial parks situated between Palo Alto and San Jose [(Adams et al., p. 863)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). Thus, the Stanford Industrial Park was a crucial element in technology firms shifting southward from San Mateo County.

Despite the influence of the Stanford Industrial Park, there was another major factor in the geographic shift of Silicon Valley. William Shockley, who headed the team that created the transistor at AT&T’s Bell Telephone Laboratories, brought the first semiconductor to Mountain View in 1955 with his company Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, a division of Beckman Instruments [(Adams et al., p. 863)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612). However in 1957 eight discontent employees, known as the "traitorous eight", at the laboratory left and created a spin-off company named Fairchild Semiconductor. This led to the explosion of semiconductor firms in the Valley, all derivatives of Shockley and Fairchild, and by the mid-1980s Silicon Valley was a centre for foundational technology. Hundreds of manufacturers were situated in Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Cupertino, Mountain View, and San Jose with companies such as Fairchild, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, National Semiconductor, Varian Associates, and Xerox [(Madrigal 2013, Not Even Silicon Valley Escapes History)](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/07/not-even-silicon-valley-escapes-history/277824/). Thus, the centre of the Valley started to move southward from San Mateo County as buildings began to replace orchards in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Santa Clara [(Adams et al., p. 863)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2017.1346612).

The geographic centre of Silicon Valley has been a shifting location for decades. This is contrary to the popular belief that the Valley emerged from Stanford University and then continued to expand outward. The Valley was a region with much different infrastructure when the geographic centre was in San Mateo County, as it mainly consisted of vacuum tube manufacturers and telecommunication firms, than when it became centred in Santa Clara and San Jose due to the explosion of semiconductor firms. Although at the beginning most of the Valley’s infrastructure was settled in San Francisco, the influence of Stanford University and their accessible land created a magnetic-like pull that shifted the Valley’s epicentre towards the South Bay Area.
