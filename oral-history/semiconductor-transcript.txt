00:14
in the 1950s Silicon Valley benefited
00:18
from convergences of Stanford
00:19
University's entrepreneurial policies
00:21
the successful examples set by
00:24
hewlett-packard and the Varian brothers
00:26
plus the beautiful climate in 1956 Nobel
00:31
laureate William Shockley would bring to
00:33
Silicon Valley of a transistor and a
00:35
team of the brightest young minds in
00:37
electronics age of these brilliant young
00:40
men left Shockley to start Fairchild
00:42
Semiconductor Shockley called these
00:46
former employees the traitorous age the
00:49
fairchild was really the first major
00:55
fountain of all of this technology
00:57
growth and and invention the only
01:00
semiconductor company that was here
01:04
prior to Fairchild of any any great
01:08
moment was Shockley laboratories someone
01:10
suggested we should talk to bill
01:12
Shockley because he has great insight
01:13
into this kind of thing so the meeting
01:17
was arranged and Bernie and I went over
01:19
there and we met with Shockley and
01:21
Bernie described to what we were doing
01:23
and then Shockley asked a question like
01:26
does some phenomena happen at this point
01:28
and and Bernie Woodrow said well why
01:31
would you expect that to happen and
01:33
Shockley looked at him said because
01:35
mother nature's a bitch it's my own
01:44
experience that to do creative work
01:46
one must overextend oneself one must
01:49
count on falling on his face on getting
01:52
into difficulties one must learn from
01:53
these failures and not be stopped by
01:55
them but one but if one is taught that
01:58
everything is neat and orderly and one
02:00
never gets into a mess when trying to do
02:02
anything new then you will be so
02:04
conservative that I don't think he'll
02:05
break new ground I think the big
02:07
contribution that can be made maybe the
02:10
biggest educational contribution that
02:11
could be made to the creativity of
02:12
people is to persuade them that they
02:16
shouldn't worry about making mistakes
02:17
this will be inevitable
02:20
with Fairchild Semiconductor and is
02:23
hundreds of spin-offs sometimes called
02:25
fair children the convergence in Silicon
02:28
Valley was now driven by a new cutting
02:30
edge technology semiconductors aided by
02:33
the arrival of venture capital
