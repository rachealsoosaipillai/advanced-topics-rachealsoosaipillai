# Intro

This webpage features a short oral history [audio clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PczRdOUI5wQ), from the *Silicon Valley Historical Association*, that covers the post-war boom in Silicon Valley and the important contributions made by William Shockley and Fairchild Semiconductor.

The next section contains an essay going into more depth on how Fairchild Semiconductor aided in developing a new culture and community for technology that led to Silicon Valley becoming a global technology centre.
